How to run the program?

First, open file in VSCode, run in terminal

Second, input the command python3 sokoban_solver "filename1" "filename2"
- "filename1" is the testcase you want to run, we provide two types: MiniCosmos.txt or MicroCosmos.txt
- "filename2" is the result file name you want to save the result of the program.

Third, after run the command, it asks you to choose testcase number to run. Enter the number form 1 to 40 (it means 40 levels in MiniCosmos or MicroCosmos)
Then it asks you to choose algorithm to run, enter 1 to run BFS, 2 to run A_star or 3 to run both algorithm above.
